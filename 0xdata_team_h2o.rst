**Cliff Click**
Hacker, Co-Founder/CTO

**Matt Fowles**
Hacker, Director of Engineering

  Matt is a consummate systems engineer and hacker.  As a resident of New York, he is one of our few remote hackers. He graduated from Swarthmore College with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. While employed at Bluefin Robotics, Matt worked on sensor fusion, dynamic control, mission planning, and data analysis for autonomous underwater robots. At StreamBase Systems, he assisted in the design and building of a programming language, compiler, and runtime environment for ultra low latency complex event processing. He has always walked the edge between the theory and applied portions of computer science with a systems level view; 0xData is a chance to turn his focus from nanoseconds to terabytes. 
  
  Matt treasures the joy that comes from spending time with his family and friends. He enjoys traveling the world for both purposes of retreat and philanthropy.


**Kevin Normoyle**
Hacker

  Kevin, a distinguished engineer, is gifting 0xdata with his many talents. Kevin has been an eminent design engineer for over thirty years. A few of his successes include acting as Lead engineer and architect for a on-chip interconnect block between the GPU compute engines and the shared memory system in a Fusion architecture CPU+GPU, Lead Architect for the i-series SPARC processor line, and Also worked defining the new memory model between GPU and CPU that is one of the cornerstones for AMD's new Fusion System Architecture. 0xdata is thankful for his introspection and passion in guaranteeing a great customer experience. Kevin believes 0xdata has made something faster, bigger, less inexpensive, and yet more reliable than anything before. 
  
  Kevin’s biggest accomplishments are his two children who are both away at college. He is passionate in dog agility, Amateur Radio, and climbing. Kevin also receives a huge rush with every big silicon chip project. He has been a part of several teams that pulled together on something long and hard, trying to achieve a definition of “perfection” for an instant in time, and succeeding.


**Tomas Nykodym**       
Hacker 

  Tomas is currently in the process of finishing his PhD at Binghamton University.  His area of research is behavioral malware detection. He received his undergraduate degree from the Czech Technical University. Tomas has worked at IBM-research and Agent-Technology Group. He has participated on several projects related to malware detection/protection funded by US Air Force. Specifically, he developed a system for modeling software behavior using compressed graphs of the system calls made on the system. Tomas also created a sandbox with simulated user activity for safe execution of malware with advanced behavior extraction algorithms to extract behavior of malware injected into other processes. 
  
  Apart from his work, Tomas spends his time mountain biking, skiing, snowboarding, and staying active.

**Cyprien Noel**
Hacker

  After receiving his Masters in Computer Science, Cyprien worked at a trading software in France. He enjoyed working with prominent figures of the open source world while writing high throughput and low latency systems. Then he took the opportunity to move to New York as a Project Manager to deploy the technology at a client organization. Three years ago he moved again, to California, and founded the ObjectFabric open source project. The project has been deployed at NASA for a distributed Air Control simulator. Cyprien regularly speaks about his software at conference venues such as C3S2E10, JavaOne, CloudSlam, and StrangeLoop. 

  Outside of work, Cyprien enjoys getting to know and spending time with the communities of artists, futurists, and burners. He looks forward to discovering all the many treasures California has to offer.
